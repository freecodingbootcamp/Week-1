# GIT Clone


## How To 

Copy the repo url, you can find that in the repo. 
Look for the green button named "Code" on the right.  

```
git clone [repo url]
cd [name of folder]
git remote origin
```
You can also verify the origins or URLs that git has stored

```
git remote -v
origin	https://github.com/freecodingbootcamp/Intro_to_GIT.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/freecodingbootcamp/Intro_to_GIT.git (push)
```
