## **List of Key Terms**.
These will come up in during your learning journey!

**1. API**

API stands for “Application Program Interface.” This is how computers and applications can communicate with one another.

**2. Cache**

Cache is temporary data storage that helps site speed by storing relevant information on your computer the first time you visit a website. Thanks to cache, when you visit the website again, your computer does not have to reload all the website information as its already saved.

**3. Cookies**

Don’t get this confused with the dessert that Cookie Monster loves so much.

This is data saved by your web browser on to your computer. It identifies you -- from how often you visit a site, to what parts you visit the most, even your preferences when browsing and more.

**4. CSS**

CSS stands for “Cascading Style Sheets.” This code that tells the browser how to display your website. This includes global styles for fonts, colors, images, menus, etc.

**5. CMS**

CMS stands for [“Content Management System](https://www.impactbnd.com/blog/top-10-cms-platforms-for-digital-marketing).” This is a software system (like HubSpot or WordPress) that is used to edit the content on your website.

**6. Crawl**

This is what it is called when a search engine sends a bot to your website to gather information on pages that exist and no longer exist and update their database on the information it has gathered. It is necessary to get indexed by search engines and get found.

**7. CDN**

CDN stands for “Content Delivery Network.” This is a system of computers with scripts and other content that are used by many websites. The content on these computer will often be cached and be helpful in speeding up your website.

**8. DNS**

This is always a hard one to fully explain and [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/) does an awesome job.

“The Domain Name System (DNS) is basically the phonebook of the Internet. Humans access information online through domain names, like nytimes.com or espn.com. Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.

DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources.”

**9. Favicon**

Short for “Favorite Icon,” this is the icon that appears in your website browser tab.

**10. Framework**

A framework is defined as “[a package made up of a structure of files and folders of standardized code (HTML, CSS, JS documents etc.).](https://www.awwwards.com/what-are-frameworks-22-best-responsive-css-frameworks-for-web-design.html)”

This is a technical way of saying a set of software tools that helps people build websites easier.

(Examples: Bootstrap, Skeleton)

**11. FTP**

FTP is short for “File Transfer Protocol.” When it comes to websites, this is how files are uploaded to the internet.

**12. Hosting**

Hosting refers to a web server where the files for your website are stored.

**13. HTML**

Also known as “Hypertext Markup Language,” this is the language that is used to build your website pages and display content like content, images, video, and links on the web.

**14. HTTP & HTTPS**

[Instant SSL](https://www.instantssl.com/ssl-certificate-products/https.html) states, Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is the secure version of HTTP, the protocol over which data is sent between your browser and the website that you are connected to.

The 'S' at the end of HTTPS stands for 'Secure.' It means all communications between your browser and the website are encrypted. HTTPS is often used to protect highly confidential online transactions like online banking and online shopping order forms.

**15. Javascript**

Javascript is a programing language that is commonly used to create interactive effects within web browsers. For example, clicking on a frequently asked question and having the answer appear below.

**16. Meta Tag**

A meta tag is an important HTML tag for SEO ranking as it stores information about the web page. Search engines use this information to categorize websites and display information in the results.

**17. Responsive Design**

Responsive design is a website that should respond to the user’s behavior and environment based on screen size. This is done automatically by using breakpoints/media queries in the CSS file.

**18. Server Side Scripting**

Server Side Scripting is a technique used in development which involves utilizing scripts on a web server that produce a custom response for each user’s request to the website.

**19. Sitemap**

This is organization chart of all the pages on a website (and [they’re very important](https://www.impactbnd.com/blog/why-sitemaps-are-undervalued).)

**20. SSL**

SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer and is a standard security protocol for establishing encrypted links. This ensures that all data transmitted between the web server and the browser remains secure.

**21. User Experience (UX)**

UX or user experience is the interaction a user has with an interface (such as an app or a website page).

**22. User Interface (UI)**

UI is the interaction between the visitor and a computer.  

**23. Agile**

A is for agile, a major buzzword across the entire tech industry right now. Agile web development essentially refers to a particular way of working, and you’ll often hear this term in the startup world. In an agile team, web developers will work according to weekly or biweekly sprints. A sprint usually consists of five phases: design, develop, test, deploy and review. You can [learn more about agile web development here]

**24. Algorithm**

An algorithm is basically a set of steps for carrying out certain tasks. In computer programming, algorithms are a key part of problem-solving. When creating an algorithm, developers will document all the necessary steps it took to arrive at a solution to a problem, and what each step involved.

**25. Backend**

Backend development essentially refers to everything that goes on behind the scenes. What happens at the backend — or server-side — powers what happens at the frontend, i.e. what the user sees and interacts with. Backend development can be broken down into four main components of a software stack: the server, the database, the operating system, and the software. You can [learn more about the difference between frontend and backend here](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/web-development/whats-the-difference-between-frontend-and-backend/).

**25. Deployment**

Deployment is a key step in the web development process. Once a website or an app has been developed and tested, it’s ready to go live; in other words, it’s ready to be deployed. There are several different stages to deploying a website — [read about them here](https://www.webpagefx.com/blog/web-design/5-fundamental-steps-to-deploying-a-website/).

**26. Data structures**

A crucial aspect of development and programming, data structures are a way of organizing and storing data for maximum efficiency — much like books in a library. Data structures make it easy to find, access, sort, insert and delete data. There are many different types of data structures, including linked lists, stacks, queues and sets.

**27. Frontend**

Remember how the backend is everything that goes on behind the scenes, and powers what goes on at the frontend? The frontend of a website, also known as client-side, is what the end user sees and interacts with. Frontend languages include HTML, CSS and JavaScript, which all have a hand in determining the visual output of a website.

**28. Full-stack**

We’ve already covered both the frontend and the backend: now it’s time to throw full-stack development into the mix. [Full-stack developers work across all three layers](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/web-development/what-is-a-full-stack-web-developer/): the frontend, the backend and the database layer. Because of the sheer depth of their knowledge across the entire spectrum, full-stack developers tend to have years of industry experience behind them.

**29. Git**

An absolute staple in the web development world, Git is a version control system where developers can store and manage their code. As a web developer, you’ll make constant changes to your code whenever you’re in the process of creating something, be it an app or a website. Git enables you to track these changes and reverse them if necessary, and also to work together with other teams and manage multiple projects at once.

**30. GitHub**

GitHub is a cloud interface for Git. It has been around since 2008 and now has over 28 million users worldwide, making it the largest host of source code in the world! GitHub offers all the version control functionality of Git, but also offers its own features, such as bug tracking, task management and project wikis. [Discover why GitHub is so important for web developers here](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/web-development/what-do-developers-use-github-for-heres-why-its-vital/).

**31. jQuery**

Remember JavaScript? Well jQuery is a JavaScript library (we’ll go into libraries further down the glossary). jQuery basically simplifies the task of using JavaScript on your website by condensing several lines of JavaScript code into a single line. Rather than adding many lines of JavaScript code, the developer can simply take the “compact version” from the jQuery library.

**32. Libraries**

As we saw with the example of JavaScript (the programming language) and jQuery (a JavaScript library), libraries can save developers considerable time and effort. Libraries are stores of pre-written code, or modules, that programmers can take and insert into the code they’re writing.

Other terms:
server, client, console, print

## Web Development and Developers

The odin project has a pretty decent page dedicated to introducing web development:

## [Optional] Developer Roadmap Path
Here is a slightly overloaded / confusing developers roadmap.  At least for brand new developers and in my opinion.
