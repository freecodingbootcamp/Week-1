# FRONT-END INTRO

If back-end is the factory where goods are produced, front-end is the store where the goods are sold! Front-end is what the user sees. Front-end is HTML, CSS and JavaScript all running and rendering within the users browser. You can see all the code that being run! Nothing is hidden. Everything is in plain sight. Front-end is more concerned about how things look and handling user interactions. It does not worry about  retrieving sensitive information from a database. It can however request that information from the back-end. Front-end is light while back-end is heavy.

What about front-end developers versus backend developers?
Well, front-end developers definitely dress better, watch more Netflix shows than read official software documentations. They also prefer using an ipad over a linux machine.
Backend developers are always concerned about the Big O! Efficiency is everything to them. They write complex queries and usually take huge pride in knowing the difference in speed amongst the different frameworks.

I think you are kind of getting the idea, right?

 As you embark on this journey in becoming a web-developer it is important to recognize what kind of developer you truly are. And yes, you can be both a front-end and back-end developer but I highly doubt you will be equally good at both of them or even enjoy them equally. It's a little bit like being a politician and a decent human being at the same. Just kidding of course. It's definitely possible...  

Let's talk about the technologies and languages associated with front-end web development:

 1. HTML
 2. CSS
 3. JavaScript
 4. Browser

 Of course there is more to that but not really. At the core those are the languages/technologies you will be mainly focused on as a front-end developer. Everything else is some sort of extension of those. For example jQuery. jQuery is just an extension of JavaScript. Bootstrap is just an extension of CSS in combination with JavaScript.
