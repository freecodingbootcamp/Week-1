# INTRO-HTML

HTML stands for...who cares! When was the last time anybody couldn't solve a programming problem because they did not know what HTML stood for. Besides you did not sign up for this bootcamp to get a Computer Science education. You signed up for this bootcamp to learn enough coding to land your first developer job. And that is where the real learning starts anyways.

But anyways, back to HTML. You might still be wondering what DOES HTML actually stand for? It stands for Hypertext Markup Language. The key here is Markup. What does it markup? Simple, text! Just text. It tells the browser what kind each piece of text on a page is. The best example/analogy I have ever read on HTML - I have read more than two - was in a book about HTML. Remember back in the day when we had newspapers?
It had blog posts printed on a weird type of paper, was kind of tall and left your fingers with a strange black residue.
Well anyways. The point I am trying to make is HTML would be the perfect language to organize those articles on a page.
